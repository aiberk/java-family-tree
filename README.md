# java-family-tree

The program asks for the name of the family data file and then prompts for a specific
personâ€™s name. If the person is in the family database, the program shows all the
ancestors and all the descendants for that person. For ancestors it must show all parents,
all grandparents, all great grandparents, etc. For descendants it must show all children,
all grandchildren, all great grandchildren, etc. The program also must use indentation to
make it clear who is a parent of whom and who is a child of whom
